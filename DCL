Data Control Language (DCL)

1. Data Control Language (DCL) is used to control access and manage user permissions within a database. 
2. It ensures data security and determines who can perform operations like data manipulation and retrieval.
3. DCL stands for Data Control Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to control access to data in a database. 
4. DCL commands manage user permissions and security by granting or revoking privileges on database objects.

5. GRANT: Assigns specific privileges (like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to users or roles.
6. REVOKE: Removes previously granted privileges from users or roles.
7. DCL ensures that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data.


## Main DCL Commands
# 1. GRANT Command
The GRANT command gives specific privileges to users or roles.

GRANT privilege_list
ON object
TO user/role [WITH GRANT OPTION];

#Common privileges include:

SELECT
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
ALL PRIVILEGES

-- Grant read access to an employee table
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO analyst1;

-- Grant multiple privileges
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON customers TO role_sales;

-- Grant with option to grant to others
GRANT SELECT ON products TO manager WITH GRANT OPTION;

..................................................................
..................................................................

REVOKE privilege_list
ON object
FROM user/role;

.................................................................
.................................................................

-- Remove update access
REVOKE UPDATE ON employees FROM analyst1;

-- Revoke all privileges
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON customers FROM role_sales;

-- Revoke grant option
REVOKE GRANT OPTION FOR SELECT ON products FROM manager;

Best practices:

Follow principle of least privilege
Regularly audit permissions
Use roles instead of individual grants when possible
Document permission changes
Remove unused privileges promptly

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of GRANT and REVOKE?


-- Create analyst user
CREATE USER 'analyst1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';

-- Create inventory manager user
CREATE USER 'inventory1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';

-- Create full access admin user
CREATE USER 'retail_admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'adminpass';


üìä GRANT SELECT to Analyst
GRANT SELECT ON retail_db.* TO 'analyst1'@'localhost';

üì¶ GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE on inventory to Inventory Manager
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON retail_db.product_inventory TO 'inventory1'@'localhost';

üõ†Ô∏è GRANT ALL to Admin
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON retail_db.* TO 'retail_admin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

‚ùå Step 3: REVOKE Permissions
‚ùå REVOKE INSERT from inventory1

REVOKE INSERT ON retail_db.product_inventory FROM 'inventory1'@'localhost';

‚ùå REVOKE ALL from analyst

REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON retail_db.* FROM 'analyst1'@'localhost';

üîç Check Permissions
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'inventory1'@'localhost';


‚úÖ Example Use Case Test

-- Success
SELECT * FROM product_inventory;

-- Success
UPDATE product_inventory SET quantity = 10 WHERE product_id = 301;

-- Fails (INSERT was revoked)
INSERT INTO product_inventory (product_id, quantity) VALUES (999, 20);
